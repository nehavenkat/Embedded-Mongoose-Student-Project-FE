    Module 8 - D2

    Implement a NICE portfolio page.

    In the last module we implemented the a Students / Portfolio website.

    It's now important that you start building app a React App that uses the API.

    Connect to your own API should be easy right now, so focus on implementing a GREAT client for using the APIs.

    Consider that we'll use this project in the next days, so try to make it as clean as possible.

    If you miss some API in the backend, is the right moment to implement them.

    Features:

    - Home: In the home page it should be possible to have a quick intro about the website and to see
    the complete list of students. Also a list of the last 5 projects should be available

    - Student: In the student page you should see the user details and the list of projects.
    In this page is also possible to edit a student and add a project

    - Project: in the project page, the user must be able to see the project details. The user can also review a 
    given project.
